SmartCAMPOST — Intelligent Parcel Tracking, Collection, and Delivery System Using QR Code, GPS, and AI

🚀 Overview

SmartCAMPOST is an innovative digital solution designed to modernize postal logistics in Cameroon by leveraging CAMPOST’s national infrastructure.
It enables users to track parcels in real-time, request home pickups, and manage payments digitally using Orange Money, MTN MoMo, or CAMPOST Money.

The system integrates:

QR Code–based parcel identification

GPS for delivery route tracking

AI-powered predictions for delivery time and anomaly detection

SMS and push notifications for transparent customer updates

🎯 Objectives

Simplify the customer experience through real-time tracking and digital payments.

Reduce lost or delayed parcels via automated event scanning.

Enable home pickup and delivery coordination through GPS.

Optimize postal operations using AI-based data insights.

💡 Innovation

Combines AI + QR Code + GPS for intelligent tracking.

Digitalization of postal operations across Cameroon.

Predictive analytics to enhance logistics efficiency.

End-to-end transparency for both agents and clients.

📱 How It Works

Client creates or requests pickup via mobile app.

System generates a unique QR Code for the parcel.

Agent scans QR at each transit or delivery stage.

Client receives automatic SMS or push notifications on status updates.

Payment and invoice generation happen seamlessly in-app.

AI predicts estimated delivery time based on distance and past trends.
